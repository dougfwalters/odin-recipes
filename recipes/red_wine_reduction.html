    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Our red wine reduction makes anything you've had at a restaurant taste like watered down steak sauce.
    Generally speaking - this reduction is much thicker and more flavorful than any other recipe we have tried. <br> You dont need a really expensive bottle to make this reduction - just grab anything from the bottom shelf and that'll work.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>Olive Oil - 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Shallot - 1 (medium size) </li>
        <li>Carbernet Wine - 1 750 ml bottle, you can use another red wine - but cabernet is our favorite.</li>
        <li>Beef Stock - 1 Quart</li>
        <li>Butter - 1/4 lb. stick</li>
